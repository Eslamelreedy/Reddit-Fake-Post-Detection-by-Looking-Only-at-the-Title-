# Reddit Fake Post Detection (by Looking Only at the Title)

## Problem Formulation
The objective of this project is to develop a model that can predict whether a specific Reddit post is fake news or not based solely on its title. The input to the model is the title of the post, and the output is a binary classification indicating whether the post is fake or genuine. This task falls under the realm of binary text classification.

## Data Mining Function
The data mining function required for this task is text classification. We need to analyze the textual data (titles of Reddit posts) and build a machine learning model that can accurately classify the posts as fake or genuine.

## Challenges
- **Limited Information**: Since we are only considering the title of the post, we have limited information available to make the classification. This may pose challenges in accurately determining the authenticity of the post.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The data is raw and may contain various forms of words, such as uppercase/lowercase variations, punctuation, and special characters. We need to apply appropriate text preprocessing techniques to clean and normalize the data.
- **Class Imbalance**: The dataset is likely to be imbalanced, with a majority of posts being genuine and a smaller portion being fake. Dealing with class imbalance requires careful consideration to ensure the model does not become biased towards the majority class.

## Impact
The spread of fake news on social media platforms can have significant consequences, including misinformation, public manipulation, and erosion of trust. By developing an effective fake post detection model, we can contribute to mitigating the influence of false information and promoting a more reliable online environment.

## Ideal Solution
The ideal solution would be a model that achieves high accuracy in classifying Reddit posts as fake or genuine based solely on their titles. The model should be robust to handle different variations in title text and able to generalize well to unseen data. It should also address the challenges of limited information and class imbalance.
